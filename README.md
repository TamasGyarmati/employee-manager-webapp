# Employee Manager App

This is a simple CRUD application that allows you to manage employees via a web interface.

* The backend includes endpoints using **Minimal API**, **Controller-based API**, and **FastEndpoints**, but the project mainly uses **FastEndpoints** for handling requests.
* Employee data is managed using **Entity Framework Core**, connected to a **Microsoft SQL Server Live Database**.
* The app includes a small feature to manage **To-Do items**, which are stored in the **browser's localStorage**.
* **FluentValidation** is used to validate the `Employee` entity.

The small project aims to demonstrate clean architecture and multiple API handling strategies in a lightweight web application, serving primarily as a personal practice in working with different API handling approaches and the use of DTOs.
